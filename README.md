# Uncrafting Table - LWGJL3
Uncrafting Table for 1.14 and up.

## How?
A 1.14 version of Uncrafting Table has existed since Febuary of 2020, and official too! You can find it here: https://github.com/crazysnailboy/UncraftingTable/pull/37

Since it is in code form only, I'm going to make the actual .jar file, and maybe port it to 1.16.4.

## Why?
I like this mod, and it's a shame that it's effectively abandoned.

## Where?
If you want the source code, go to the 1.14, 1.15 or 1.16 branch. Only 1.14 is available right now.
